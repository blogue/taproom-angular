# Taproom

#### By Ben Logue & Matt Reyes

## Description

Taproom is an application which is designed to track the number of servings left in a keg and total sales. Users have the ability to create kegs and serve beer from the keg which decrements the quantity and adds to the day's sale total. The keg level is displayed graphically with a BootStrap progress bar and updates dynamically on click. Kegs that are low are highlighted to give a user notification that the keg needs to be changes.
